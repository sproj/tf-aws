next you need to set up the infrastructure modules.

think about whether the intra module for each deployment type should be a sub-module of the deployment type, or whether the deployment should inherit 
from broader infra definitions or what - learn about that.

✅ I've captured where you’re leaving off:

    Next steps for you:

        Sketch a real terraform sequence (init → plan → apply)

        Set up a remote backend (S3 + DynamoDB locking)

        Start on a real deployment module, wiring together resource roles

✅ Context:

    You have a working module structure for roles.

    You're clear on how to scale to multi-repo architecture later.

    Naming and trust policies are aligned with best practices.
